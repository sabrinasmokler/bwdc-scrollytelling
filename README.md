# BWDC Scrollytelling Project

This is a scrollytelling data story built with **Svelte**, **Highcharts**, and **custom CSS animations**, inspired by the [Black Wealth Data Center](https://blackwealthdata.org). It highlights the systemic revenue disparities between Black- and white-owned businesses and explores the structural barriers behind them.

## 🛠️ Built With

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) – UI framework
- [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/) – Data visualizations
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) – Fast development environment
- HTML/CSS – Custom styling and animations
- Git + GitHub – Version control and hosting

## 💡 Idea & Purpose

All ideas, design choices, and narrative structure were created by **me**, Sabrina Smokler. I wanted to combine storytelling with data to make an emotional and visual impact about racial wealth disparities in the United States.

I used **ChatGPT** as a collaborative assistant to help refine animations, transitions, and code structure — but the content, layout, and direction were fully mine.

## ✨ Features

### `TitleCard`
I wanted something that felt bold, glowing, and vibrant to open the experience. I used the following prompt for inspiration:  
> "Create a high-impact title section that grabs attention with bold color, rounded borders, and glowing effects."

ChatGPT helped refine the styling and transitions to match the energy I was going for.

### `Scroller.svelte`
This section enables the classic sticky + scroll effect where charts or text stay in place as the user scrolls. I implemented the dual-pane layout and got feedback on responsiveness and styling from ChatGPT.

### `Challenges Section`
Each barrier is animated as the user scrolls down. I outlined the four main obstacles (funding, geography, wealth legacy, risk bias), and ChatGPT helped me script the animations using Intersection Observer and styled cards with CSS.

---

### `CTA Section`
A clear call to action invites the user to take what they’ve learned and support real change. I asked for help in making this section visually distinct and motivating without being overwhelming.
